        WHAT IS STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHY?
        In its truest sense, studio photography is preformed indoors, in a managed setting where the photographer has complete control over all of the elements that go into creating a photograph.

        Studio photography is used to shoot a wide variety of subjects, including people, animals and wide variety of products, from automobiles to jewellery. A photography studio will usually start out as a blank space, meaning just an empty room. The photographer will then develop backdrops and decide what to include and exclude from the photo, such as costumes for models and props.
